# RIBES: Rank-based Intuitive Bilingual Evaluation Score

## What's RIBES?

RIBES is an automatic evaluation metric for machine translation, developed in NTT Communication Science Labs.
This website distributes its implementation in Python.  
The program is distributed based on GNU General Public License (ver.2)ï¼Ž
You have to confirm the agreement with the license terms before download.


## How to Use

```bash
$ python RIBES.py -r REFERENCE_TRANSLATION EVALUATING_TRANSLATION
```
Also you can see other options by the following:
```
$ python RIBES.py -h
```

## File Format

* Reference and evaluating files are plain text files, not SGML or XML.
* Reference and evaluating files must have the same number of lines.
* Each line must be tokenized including punctuations (The program does not change tokenization).
